# fake-mock-stub
A tutorial on how to use fakes, mocks and stubs in Java

This is not intended to be an exercise in TDD, as that would require the test to drive the development. This exercise is designed to get an understanding of how you can use mocks, stubs and fakes in a test so hopefully these can be used for TDD in future.

# exercise 1
Implement test with mocks, to prove certain methods are being called

# exercise 2
Implement test with stubs, to check certain methods are being called depending on which value is returned from the stub

# exercise 3
Implement test using a fake, to prove that a string builder function will return expected String given particular input
